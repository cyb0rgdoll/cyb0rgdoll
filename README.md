👋 Hi, I’m @cyb0rgdoll, I reside in the most isolated city in Australia.
👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, IT and am studying masters in this field.
🌱 I’m currently learning few programming languages such as shell, python, go, ruby, perl, bash and few more.
💞️ Love playing CTFs, volunteering at security events and learning new skills.
